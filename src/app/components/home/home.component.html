          Welcome to Wilkware. I'm Elliot Wilkinson and this is a site to showcase myself and my work! I've just moved into the world
          of contracting and realised I needed some sort of portfolio site- and here we are! This site is new so is pretty
          bare at the moment but over the next few months I hope to rectify that by working on more projects and expanding
          the scope of this site to some more interesting aspects of myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          So about me.<br/> I hold a degree is Discrete Mathematics and have been working in Software Engineering for 4 years;
          One in C, Two in C#+WPF, and One in Typescript+Angular. But along the way I have dabbled in a whole range of other
          languages and technologies which can be viewed on my <a routerLink="/cv" routerLinkActive="active">CV</a>. Angular
          has been a welcome relief after breaking free from the shakles of WPF, and it is the Framework I consider myself
          well versed in. So I am now operating out of my own company, Wilkware Limited, offering my software engineering
          skills with a focus on C# and Angular.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding I am an avid runner and triathlete. Completing my first marathon in 2016 I vowed to do one a month in 2017,
          but injuring myself has currently put that on hold. I have currently completed 6 marathons this year and hopefully I can
          squeeze in another 6 once my injuries are healed!
